# Industrial-conveyor-design
This program runs an industrial conveyor that takes a packed product and accepts or rejects it depending on its weight (under or over). This program is for a miniature design using arduino, motors, sensors (IR sensors) and a load cell. This is not a finished product because the parts aren't fixed yet. So, It is still under construction.
